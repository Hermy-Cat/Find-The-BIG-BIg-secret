	<p>The Munchkin</br> cat or Sausage cat is a newer breed of cat characterized
	by its very short legs, which are caused by a genetic mutation.
	Much controversy erupted over the breed when it was recognized by The International
	Cat Association (TICA) in 1995 with critics voicing concern over potential health and
	mobility issues.</p>
